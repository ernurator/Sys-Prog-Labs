# Exercise 1
* `w01-byte` bytes/second: <!-- Fill this in -->
* `w02-byte` bytes/second: <!-- Fill this in -->
* `w03-byte` bytes/second: <!-- Fill this in -->

# Exercise 2
### Scenario 1:
* How many array elements can fit into a cache block?
<!-- Fill this in -->
* What combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe? Think about the sizes of each of the parameters.
<!-- Fill this in -->
* What is our hit rate if we increase Rep Count arbitrarily? Why?
<!-- Fill this in -->

### Scenario 2:
* What combination of parameters is producing the hit rate you observe? Think about the sizes of each of the parameters.
<!-- Fill this in -->
* What happens to our hit rate if we increase the number of blocks and why?
<!-- Fill this in -->

### Scenario 3:
* Choose a `number of blocks` greater than `1` and determine the smallest `block size` that uses every block *and* maximizes the hit rate given the parameters above. Explain why.
Number of blocks: <!-- Fill this in -->
Block Size: <!-- Fill this in -->

# Exercise 3
* Order the functions from fastest to slowest, and explain why each function's ranking makes sense using your understanding of how the cache works. Some functions might have similar runtimes. If this is the case, explain why.
